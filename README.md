# fusion-propeller
3D CAD model of a two-blade propeller designed around a central cylindrical hub. 
The blades feature a smooth aerodynamic profile with a gradual twist and taper from root to tip, suitable for basic propulsion or airflow simulations.
The hub includes a central mounting hole for shaft attachment.
Created for use in CAD modeling, prototyping, or educational projects involving mechanical design and aerodynamics.
